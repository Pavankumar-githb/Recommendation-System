1. User-Based vs. Item-Based Collaborative Filtering:
User-Based Collaborative Filtering: Recommends items based on similar users. 
If two users liked similar items, it suggests items liked by one user to the other.
Item-Based Collaborative Filtering: Recommends items based on similar items. 
If a user liked a particular item, it suggests other items similar to it based on other users' ratings.

2. Collaborative Filtering:
Collaborative Filtering (CF) is a recommendation technique that makes predictions based on past interactions (ratings, purchases, etc.) between users and items. 
It identifies similar users or items and recommends items based on those similarities.
It can be user-based or item-based, and it doesn’t need detailed item information—just user behavior
